Grbl is a very popoular open source firmware for controlling cnc machine.

Latest grbl v1.1h supports laser mode, command is $32=1.So I use standard grbl, you can go to grbl offically github page to check it yourself:
https://github.com/gnea/grbl.git

Grbl is a bridge between MCU and machine communicating with standard gcode language.Thus you can use any software
supporting gcode generating.That's ok.Through many software,I think Lasergrbl is a perfect choice for us.Because it is open source
and very powerful.Check it out in Software folder.
